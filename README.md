Medical Diagnosis Web Application
This is a web application for medical diagnosis based on user-entered symptoms and text extracted from uploaded images. The application utilizes machine learning models and natural language processing techniques to provide diagnoses and treatment recommendations.

Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-diagnosis.git
Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed.

Windows: Download the installer from the Tesseract OCR website and follow the installation instructions.

Linux: Use your package manager to install Tesseract OCR. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
Run the application.

Copy code

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Usage
Open the web application in your web browser.

Upload an image containing relevant medical information. The application will extract text from the image using OCR.

Enter your symptoms in the provided input field. Separate multiple symptoms with commas.

Click the "Get Diagnosis" button to receive the diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

The application will display the diagnosis, recommendation, and a health score based on the severity of the predicted diagnosis. If the health score is below 20, a link to make an appointment will be provided.

Dataset
The application uses a pre-existing dataset containing symptoms, diagnoses, treatment recommendations, and severity scores. The dataset is stored in a CSV file (data1.csv) and is used for training the machine learning model.
